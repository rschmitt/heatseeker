    <releaseNotes>
Changes in this release:

- Shell integration has been added, with initial support for zsh and
  PowerShell.
- A plugin for Vim and Neovim has been added (`rschmitt/heatseeker`).
- The Windows implementation has been updated to use virtual terminal
  mode. This should reduce flickering while redrawing the screen and
  improve support for environments like MSYS2.
- On macOS and Linux, hs now clears formatting when the terminal is
  initially opened, fixing a cosmetic issue that occurred in certain
  contexts.
- Numerous small fixes, optimizations, and modernizations have been made
  to the implementation.
